Browse, Install, and Update Wordpress plugins hosted on Github

== Description ==

! This plugin allows an administrator to browse plugins hosted on Github and manage them in a very easy way.
- Browse by keywords, owner/repository name, and direct URL
- Install from the latest release, commit, or tag.
- Switch your locally installed plugin to another release or tag version. (coming soon!)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `github-installer-updater` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it, you can start managing your Github-hosted plugins

Make sure your plugins directory is writeable by whatever local user WordPress uses.

== Screenshots ==
1. Browse Github repositories by name, owner, or URL.
2. Install a plugin from the repository's latest commit archive, release archive, or tag archive.
3. Check which release or tag version you want to install
4. Use your Github API token to get around rate limiting in case of heavy use
